# MQTT Monitoring

The purpose of this project is monitoring the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and the altitude of an ambient. It is made to operate on a ESP8266 but it can be adapted to other microcontrollers that can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. It uses a [Bosch BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/).
